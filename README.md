# Optimal Subarray Sum without Adjacent Elements
You are developing a finance analytics tool, and you need to create a Java program that efficiently calculates the maximum sum of a subarray with the condition that no two adjacent elements are included in the subarray. This is crucial for identifying the best investment opportunities without investing in consecutive periods.

Examples:
Input:  8
       -2 1 -3 4 -1 2 1 -5
Output: Maximum Subarray Sum: 7

Input:  9
       9 -2 1 3 4 -1 -2 1 -5 4
Output: Maximum Subarray Sum: 10
